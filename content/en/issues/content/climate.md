## Fire Mitigation

We can no longer fully prevent wildfires, although we can decrease the risk to our community.  We need to build resilience. Making sure our homes are fire resistant and thinning our forests that are on the wildland-urban interface are just two of the many ways we can mitigate and or manage fire risk. 

## Flood Mitigation

This spring has been the wettest in decades. I support increased flood mitigation by improving our infrastructure, especially around our many flood prone creeks.

## Climate Emergency

I fully support Boulder’s targets to address our climate emergency:
- Reduce Emissions by 70% by 2030
- Become a Net Zero City by 2035
- Become a Climate-Positive City by 2040

## Reduce Emissions by 70% by 2030

In order to achieve our emissions targets, our city government must take action to transition our infrastructure away from fossil fuels toward renewables.

### Partnerships
Let's work with our local businesses, CU, and neighborhood organizations to identify impediments and potential incentives to speed up the transition (e.g. CU is the leading source of commuting vehicle trips: 12,000+/day)

### Transportation
- Transition our city bus fleet from diesel fuel to electricity
- Purchase electric buses and support commuter rail.
- Supplement RTD’s regional efforts with Boulder Transit Authority
- Support E-bike rebate program that will bring diversification of transportation and cleaner air.

### More funds & resources
- Partner with both state and federal government to deploy funds and resources needed to reach our climate goals

## Become a Net Zero City by 2035 & Climate-Positive by 2040

We need to think broadly about the different ways we can reduce emissions and increase carbon capture, such as:
- Vehicles Miles Traveled (VMT): promote hybrid remote work and free or discounted Eco-Passes can encourage residents to drive less
- Direct air capture of carbon: support initiatives to put Boulder at forefront of new carbon reduction technology innovation
- Carbon sequestration: expand small-scale carbon sequestration projects with soils, compost, grasslands, wetlands, and planting vegetation known to consume more carbon
- Electric vehicles: increase the prevalence of EV re-charging stations and pilot a city rebates program
- Bikeways and walkways: expand our bike and pedestrian infrastructure and improve safety and access
- Rooftop solar: remove barriers for residential rooftop solar and expand community solar gardens
- Building energy efficiency standards: improve building energy efficiency performance standards for Boulder's residential and commercial structures
