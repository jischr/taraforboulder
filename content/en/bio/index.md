## My Family & Life in Boulder
My husband, 3 daughters, and I moved to Boulder over 10 years ago. At that time, my youngest, Jen, entered her senior year at Boulder High, my middle, Lexi, transferred to CU Boulder, and my oldest, Stephanie, was married at the Sunrise Amphitheater on top of Flagstaff Mountain. 

And now, 10 years later, my husband and I are empty nesters with all three of our daughters living in Boulder County. Jen and her husband live in Shanahan Ridge, Stephanie, her husband, and my 22-month-old granddaughter, Shira, also live in South Boulder, and Lexi and her husband live in nearby Louisville. If you haven’t met my daughters yet, you will soon, as they also have a  passion for public service and serve on local government and community boards.

I am passionate about the outdoors and can be found riding my electric bike through Boulder’s many bike paths and hiking with my family and friends on Boulder’s trails and the Indian Peaks Wilderness.
